This folder contains gameplay data. Be careful to distinguish between two types of gameplay files:
1. Gameplay that needs to be on by default (ex. Ethiopia_GameplayData.xml for the new content, Ethiopia_Expansion2.xml for tweaks specific to playing in the XP2 ruleset like making the Oromo Cavalry replace the Courser)
2. Gameplay that is part of an optional mode, specifying the ruleset needed (if any) and ending in “_Modes” (ex. Menelik_Expansion2_Modes.xml for content related to the Secret Societies game mode)
