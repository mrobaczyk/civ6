This folder contains gameplay data. Be careful to distinguish between two types of gameplay files:
1. Gameplay that needs to be on by default (ex. ByzantiumGaul_Units.xml for the new units in all rules sets, ByzantiumGaul_Expansion2.xml for tweaks specific to playing in the XP2 ruleset like adding named rivers)
2. Gameplay that is part of an optional mode, specifying the ruleset needed (if any) and ending in “_Modes” (ex. ByzantiumGaul_Expansion1_Modes.xml and ByzantiumGaul_Expansion2_Modes.xml for content related to the Dramatic Ages game mode)
