They were elevated to the rank of noble (i.e., patrician, as opposed to plebian) in the relatively distant time but were a minor note in the Roman republic. Julius Caesar’s story begins when he becomes the head of the family in 85BC and is almost immediately targeted by the new winner of a bloody civil war between Caesar’s kin, Gaius Marius, and Lucius Sulla. Caesar lost what little inheritance his family had and his ability to serve as a priest of Jupiter. Having relatively little, Caesar went into the military. The choice would prove dramatic.</Text>

      <Text>[COLOR_RED]TRANSLATION MISSING[ENDCOLOR][LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_JULIUS_CAESAR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4]In his early career, Caesar was noted as an opponent of Senatorial corruption and a favorite of the military. As he moved up in ranks, winning the consulate in 59BC and becoming a member of the ”triumvirate,” an alliance of Caesar and two powerful allies, Caesar curried favor with the common people, forcing land redistribution and threatening nobility with his soldiers when conflicts emerged. This won him enemies, and he secured a governorship over the fractious regions of Gaul to protect himself from retaliation. This move, too, was to shape his future.</Text>

Caesar relentlessly pushed against Gallic forces – including Ambiorix – in the Gallic Wars. But while he was away, Caesar’s opponents were actively undermining his support at home, citing irregularities in his consular election. Caesar’s once-ally Pompey assumed singular control, and senators urged for both men to disarm and thus re-establish a legal order. Neither did. Worse, Caesar began marching his victorious legions back from Gaul towards Rome.</Text>

Active armies were forbidden in Rome proper, and to cross the great river would signal a hostile action. Caesar paused here before declaring alea icata est – the die is cast. He crossed the river and altered the course of history. Civil war erupted, but Caesar’s military planning was such that he outmaneuvered his opponent Pompey, chasing him out of Italy and to Spain and Greece. Returning to Rome, Caesar was appointed dictator. It is a move that later dictators would emulate.</Text>

With a mixture of guile and menace, Caesar cowed the Senate and, famously, intervened on behalf of Cleopatra in Egypt (who became his lover). While his public persona was one favoring commoners, he restricted the power of non-nobles, both in artisans’ guilds as well as in legal reforms. In deference to Rome’s expansion, Caesar allowed for some degree of decentralization, extending legal rights beyond Italy and allowing local cities more freedom to govern as they saw fit. His dictatorship relied both on informal intimidation (he simply refused several moves by the Senate) as well as new legal powers bestowed on him by the Senate.</Text>
