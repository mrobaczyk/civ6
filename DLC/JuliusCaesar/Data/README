This folder contains gameplay data. Be careful to distinguish between two types of gameplay files:
1. Gameplay that needs to be on by default (ex. MyNewContent_Civilizations.xml for the new content, MyNewContent_Expansion2.xml for tweaks specific to playing in the XP2 ruleset)
Expansion1_Required Material will work in either expansion as long as you have Expansion1 enabled.
2. Gameplay that is part of an optional mode, specifying the ruleset needed (if any) and ending in “_Modes” (ex. MyNewContent_Modes.xml for content related to the new game mode)
