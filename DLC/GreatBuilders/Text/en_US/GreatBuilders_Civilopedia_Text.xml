			<Text>The Joseon Dynasty of Korea was one of Korea’s greatest and longest-lasting dynasties. Sejong is similarly one of – if not the – most productive and famous of this empire’s rulers, noted for building Joseon’s infrastructure, science, and artistic life.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SEJONG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The Joseon Dynasty of Korea (1392–1897) arose along with Ming. In the chaos of the Ming wars of succession against the Mongol-dominated Yuan dynasty, there were similar wars in Korea, as the rising Ming called upon Korean allies to overthrow Yuan-occupied regions of the peninsula. Sensing the weakness of both Chinese positions at this time, the general tasked with this revolted and seized power for himself, choosing Joseon as the name of the kingdom and receiving the posthumous name of Taejo. As would be expected, this thrust the region into further unrest. Unrest that would only end with the succession of Taejong’s son, Sejong (1418-1450).</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SEJONG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3">
			<Text>Sejong’s rule was deeply informed by Confucianism – something unsurprising given Confucius’s emphasis on a stable, wise rule. To this end, Sejong implemented scholarships for Confucian students and, most significantly, sponsored state scholars to create a new alphabet - hangul. Chinese characters had been previously used to write Korean words, but this script did not match with the Korean language (as Korean, like Japanese, was influenced by Chinese writing but has phonemes and conjugations that cannot be easily captured by the character-centered Chinese writing system). This was controversial, as more conservative scholars thought that the adoption of such a script would lead to a decline in education and understanding, but the script caught on and is still used today.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SEJONG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>On a less sanguine note, Sejong’s reign saw the suppression of Islam and Buddhism in Korea – the former was present in small numbers since Abbasid contact in the 9th century, and the latter had always been important but clashed with Confucian ideas – Buddhism stresses non-attachment and individual enlightenment, whereas Confucianism stresses familial responsibility and service to the state.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SEJONG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5">
			<Text>As a part of his emphasis on education, Sejong also commissioned scientific studies – notably, for the strategically-minded, the development of gunpowder weapons, and texts on farming. He offered leniency towards farmers’ taxes, and even implemented maternity leave for Korean nobi – those who had sold themselves as into slavery to escape debt. Other significant achievements included a standardized currency and the Hall of Worthies – a collection of the reign’s scientific and cultural achievements. In addition to the hangul script, these included a printing press, rain gauge, and other practical but innovative measures.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SEJONG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6">
			<Text>In foreign affairs, Joseon was a tributary state of Ming – surprising given its rebellious origins, but early Ming was in no condition to hold grudges. A tributary in the Ming system was a state that paid the throne in Beijing in order to receive protection from outside threats. This had the ancillary effect of promoting peace amongst tributaries – Joseon Korea and Ashikaga Japan enjoyed warm relations, recognizing their mutual status, although this was to collapse in two centuries, as Japan split from Ming and descended into the domestic disputes of the Sengoku era.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SEJONG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_7">
			<Text>For those not in the tributary system, Sejong was aggressive. Joseon faced Manchu states to its north (the same states that would later form the center of the Qing Dynasty of China) and Japanese pirates operating out of Tsushima, an island off of Japan’s western coast that had been a target of the failed Mongol-led invasion in a previous generation and which remained in that time a lawless frontier. Sejong’s influence there, and canny trade agreements with the local So clan, ensured that the raids stopped.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SEJONG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_8">
			<Text>Sejong died of natural causes in 1450, and although royal succession remained contentious, the infrastructure that he built formed the bones of a stable, prosperous Korean society and ensured its persistence.</Text>

			<Text>To start any [ICON_Science] Science game the pursuit begins with Writing and the unlocking of the Campus and Library. The same is true with Sejong, except that the Seowon unique district is even more powerful than the Campus. The Three Kingdoms ability gives even more [ICON_Science] Science when you place the Seowon district adjacent to Mines. These powerful [ICON_Science] Science bonuses transform into [ICON_Culture] Culture every time you advance into the next Era with Sejong. Korea is the preeminent Civilization for a Science Victory.</Text>

			<Text>“The Swan King” of the Catholic kingdom of Bavaria, Ludwig was a strange character. His reign was not a profitable one for his kingdom – it was under Ludwig that Bavaria lost its independence to Germany, but he himself was less interested in politics than in making the fairy tales of the region come to life. His projects and palaces were realms of imagination – or madness.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LUDWIG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Bavaria is the largest, but not most powerful, of the German states. Long a Catholic holdout in a greater Protestant region, Bavaria was influenced from an early time by a Roman presence. In later years, Bavaria was a powerful elector in the Holy Roman Empire and was home to the Wittelsbach monarchy (from 1214) – a dynasty that competed in the Empire with the Hapsburgs in Austria, a competition that on many occasions led to outright war. It should be noted that Bavaria and Austria are more similar in language, culture, and religion than the Prussian north.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LUDWIG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3">
			<Text>In the modern period, Bavaria played its rivals in Austria against the rising star of Prussia, to a fair degree of success, though in the end, they were forced to capitulate and join the German Federation under Prussian dominance – this is how Bavaria became a part of Germany today.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LUDWIG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>Today, Bavaria is a land of wealthy farmers, slightly conservative in outlook, with a strong Catholic bend. It is also the symbolic home of much of German folk culture – one cannot help but dream a bit, standing in the shadows of the Alps.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LUDWIG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5">
			<Text>And that is where we come to “Mad” Ludwig. Ludwig was born into Bavarian royalty (his mother, notably, was a Crown Princess of Prussia) into what was an elite and relatively cold family. From a young age, he was surrounded by myth; from walking in the Alps to his childhood home at Castle Hohenschwangau, a Gothic-style fantasy castle devoted to Lohengrin, the Knight of the Swans, to his fascination with Wagner. Knights, dragons, nixies, and fairies ruled in young Ludwig’s life, even when, at age 19, he himself came to rule Bavaria.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LUDWIG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6">
			<Text>Ludwig’s sexuality is also worth noting here. He was gay and had several affairs with his guards – indeed, a shared sexuality was another reason why Wagner and Ludwig were sympathetic (Ludwig did not, though, share Wagner’s antisemitism).</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LUDWIG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_7">
			<Text>Ludwig’s loyalty to the Alps, and his friendship with the Austrian royalty, moved his sympathies in that direction, which was diplomatically unwise; when Prussia defeated Austria, Bavaria was pulled into the former’s diplomatic orbit and eventually forced into unification with Germany, though, as befitted Bavaria’s size and power, it was permitted its own army and a great deal of independence.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LUDWIG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_8">
			<Text>This forced abdication of Ludwig’s political ambitions enabled his fantasies to take flight. The 19th century was an era of nationalism, where various countries, new and old, were invested in discovering, embellishing upon, and, at times, fully inventing their own particular national cultures. For Ludwig, castle construction (as well as serving as Wagner’s patron) was a key part of this – his Neuschwanstein. This was a castle inspired by the Swan Knight legends that formed a part of Ludwig’s early life – the story of a knight that arrives in a swanlike boat to defend the honor of the innocent but must never be asked his name. It also is a monument to absolute monarchy, and the divine right of kings in combination with nationalism – the majesty of kings derives from the spirits of the land. But this was not his only project – he planned a replica of Versailles and another Gothic castle on “wild, romantic” Falkenstein, and built a French-styled castle at Linderhof and a magnificent apartment in the Bavarian castle of Munich.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LUDWIG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_9">
			<Text>Castles are wonderful. But also expensive. Ludwig fell deep into debt, so much so that his administration decided that he was mad. He was seized, but the day after, as he was awaiting transportation, he and his doctor were found dead in a lake on his royal grounds. The death was ruled a suicide (and, in the doctor’s case, a murder), but forensic evidence, for what it was worth at the time, did not seem to indicate this, implying something darker. The end is perhaps fitting; Ludwig was often quoted as saying, “I wish to remain an eternal enigma to myself and others.”</Text>

			<Text>With Ludwig, build as many districts as a city can have, which, with Germany’s civilization ability is one more than everyone else. Then, place wonders all around your district - even if you do not finish them they will bring you [ICON_Culture] Culture. The Hansa unique district will help their completion with its extra [ICON_Production] Production. By the Modern Era, you have protection if any jealous rivals try to steal your wonders -- for then your U-Boats, the swans of the modern era, will surely thwart their invasions. Unlocking Castles is the lynchpin in Ludwig’s pursuit for a Culture Victory with it providing [ICON_Tourism] Tourism to every district that provides [ICON_Culture] Culture - including unfinished wonders.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_THEODORA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>A former actress (and brothel worker), Theodora (c. 500-548) rose to hold a powerful influence over her husband, the Emperor Justinian of the Byzantine Empire. She was instrumental in fortifying what would become Orthodox Christianity and in building the backbone of the Byzantines in an era of collapse elsewhere in the Empire.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_THEODORA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The early first millennium AD was a difficult one for the Byzantines. With the West splintered into hundreds of smaller kingdoms, the East rich but full of potential enemies, and the North still full of potentially dangerous barbarian tribes, Constantinople needed a vision for a path forward. And Justinian (r. 527-565) provided that path.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_THEODORA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3">
			<Text>The Eastern Roman Empire was divided on several grounds – linguistically, between Greek and Latin, religiously, between Chalcedonian and Miaphysite branches of Christianity, between various classes within the cities, and regionally. Justinian embarked upon the  Renovatio Imperii, the “restoration of the Empire”, a reconquest and solidification campaign involving expansion against enemies on all sides – those groups who were dismantling the Western Roman Empire. Significantly, this meant the reconquest of Italy and Spain, as well as the barbarian kingdoms of the Vandals in North Africa. At home, Justinian wrote a code of laws to stand the test of time until the present, and (using money gained by the reconquest of the West) built wonders in the capital, such as the Hagia Sophia.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_THEODORA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>Theodora was a Greek, the daughter of a bear trainer in Constantinople. She enters history working in a brothel as an actress performing relatively salacious shows, and grew close with a group of dancers from the Blue faction – a chariot-racing team. In essence, cheerleaders. From there, Theodora caught Justinian’s eye, so much so that he amended the law prohibiting high-ranking individuals from marrying actresses, after which he promptly married her.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_THEODORA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5">
			<Text>Her first test came in the Nika riots, a conflict between Blue and Green chariot fans that nearly destroyed Constantinople. When Justinian and his councilors were preparing to flee the capital as the mobs descended into anarchy, Theodora appealed to his sense of authority – to flee would be worse than death, she said, or, more poetically, “royal purple is the noblest shroud.”</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_THEODORA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6">
			<Text>The gambit was successful – Justinian cracked down on the riots and re-established his power. From there, Theodora was always at his side, and her influence can be seen in his reforms of marriage codes, her own charity towards young women and girls born into situations similar to her own, and in constant court machinations.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_THEODORA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_7">
			<Text>Religiously, she clashed with her husband, promoting Miaphysite Christianity at a time when it was being actively suppressed. The difference between the two branches may seem obscure now, but it was a matter of life and death in the 500s. In essence, at the Council of Chalcedon, priests had decreed that Jesus was one person with a separate human and divine nature, whereas Miaphysites held that he had but one nature, one that was both fully human and fully divine. Today, Miaphysite philosophy forms the core of Ethiopian Christianity, whereas Chalcedonian philosophy informs both Catholicism (and Protestantism) and Eastern Orthodoxy (Greece and Russia).</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_THEODORA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_8">
			<Text>Before her death at the likely age of 48, Theodora helped to keep a poly-religious, poly-ethnic (Justinian spoke Latin, whereas Theodora was Greek) state intact at a moment when it could very well have spiraled out of control. This is, in a sense, the old order of things that would become less broad and more narrowly focused as the forces chipping away at Byzantium grew stronger and provoked more and more stubborn responses – as in the reign of Basil II.</Text>
